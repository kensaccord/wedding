                <img src="images/photos/jim-connie.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="186" class="photo-creative" />
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Connie and James have been married over 20 years.</span> While they did not have children of their own, their foster child Alex and their grand nieces Lucy and Sylvia  enriched their lives over the years. So did their yellow lab KAI who lived with them over 13 years until he died in 2010. Alex has grown up but Connie and James still love child-sitting Lucy and Sylvia. They also enjoy walking and playing with their rescued chocolate lab CoCo, shopping for treasures at resale stores, talking to and laughing with each other. Their vacation time is spent in the quiet of the Upper Peninsula in a cabin on Lake Superior near the Porcupine Mountains where, with CoCo leading the way, they hike in the forest, explore the waterfalls and collect stones on the beach. At the cabin, they both enjoy reading mystery novels. Connie also brings puzzles and Jim brings Legos to relax by the fireplace. </p>

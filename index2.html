    <p>
        Boo-hoo’d like a baby while listening to this on my way to work this morning. GRACE.
        Almost a year ago, I fb’d Ken to ask him about a church that my coworker raved about
        (thanks Mark!) that I recalled Ken “checking into” (even though I barely knew him….we
        had met at a comedy club 4/5 years prior for a friends bday (thanks Arlenea! Thanks
        Tice Owens!) Grey and I had just moved out after living with family during my pregnancy
        and most of his first year. (thanks Linsey Babitzke Simmons) and I really wanted to
        find a church home. Me- I see you check in at Gateway….how do you like it? Ken- I love
        it..;If you need someone to go with… FIRST “DATE” was to church at Gateway Church and
        then dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. PATIENCE. It really IS a virtue and he must be
        a monk. smile emoticon Resistant isn’t the word. Past disappointments had me jaded
        and dating was the LAST thing on my mind; my only focus was to be a good mom, work,
        and that was about it. RESILIANT. Ken was patient, consistent, and a really great
        friend and after 4/5 months, I agreed to be his girlfriend. He adores me. He loves
        my son. He loves God. Fast forward to now... GRATEFUL. Not what I deserved. GRACE
